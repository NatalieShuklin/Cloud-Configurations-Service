Explanation:

**BranchProtectionRiskDemo Class:**

Simulated Risks: this class simulates what happens if branch protection is misconfigured. For example:

- Unreviewed code could be merged if pull request reviews aren't required.
- Untested code could be merged if status checks aren't enforced.
- Unauthorized changes could be pushed directly to the branch if push restrictions aren't in place.


**DependabotRiskDemo Class:**

Simulated Risks: This class simulates the consequences of not enabling Dependabot alerts. For example:

- A critical vulnerability might go unnoticed if alerts aren't enabled.
